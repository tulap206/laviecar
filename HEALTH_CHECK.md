## 🚀 How to Run Health Check

### Option 1: From Browser (Recommended)

1. **Deploy to Vercel**
2. **Access your app:** https://your-domain.vercel.app
3. **The app will connect to Supabase** from the browser environment

⚠️ The command-line health check won't work from development machine due to Supabase network restrictions.

### Option 2: Custom Health Check Script

Create a simple Next.js API route to run health checks:

```typescript
// app/api/health-check/route.ts
import { fetchCustomers, fetchVehicles, fetchRentals, fetchTransactions } from '@/lib/supabase'

export async function GET() {
  const tests = {
    customers: await fetchCustomers(),
    vehicles: await fetchVehicles(),
    rentals: await fetchRentals(),
    transactions: await fetchTransactions(),
  }
  
  return Response.json({
    status: 'OK',
    timestamp: new Date(),
    tests
  })
}
```

Then access: `https://your-domain/api/health-check`

## 🚨 If Tests Fail

### "Host not in allowlist"
- This is expected when running from command line
- The app will work fine from the browser
- This is a Supabase security restriction

### "Table missing"
- Create table in Supabase
- Run SQL: `CREATE TABLE transactions (...)`

### Calculation Issues
- Check revenue field is populated
- Verify status is 'completed'
- Check totalPrice calculation

### Data Missing
- Empty database is OK
- Add test data manually
- Or import from backup
